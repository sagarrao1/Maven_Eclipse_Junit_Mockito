Difference  between when and verify in mockito

When is used when we ask test to setup something before running the test
When is used when we need to setup up something like external method calls or raise exception

Verify is used to tell something to verify
Verify is used when we neeed to veirfy where there is not return values for method like void methods
We want to make sure certain method is called when we run our test , we use verify for this

Void class.method()

Verify(MockClass, atLeastOnce()  ). Save();



spies we need to use carefully 
when you call method on spy , a real method gets called unless you explicitly stubed out that method
It actually creates and uses copy of real object
we need to use spy when we can't refactor code or when we are not able to use mock on that object
or legacy code which are new operator to create object
